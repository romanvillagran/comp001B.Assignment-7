    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
    <p>Youtube videos, Having a visual demonstration really helped with know what does what and how it can affect your page. </p>
    <br>
    
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
    <p> I guess adding more visual demonstration because sometimes I would look at the assignment i'm working on and I would start to think that i'm doing it wrong and start the whole thing over. </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
    <p> yeah I did and it wasn't easy because i'm not very good at designing things and sometimes it would take me a day or two to finally have a design idea. </p>
    <br>

    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
    <p> bootstrap, kinda got confused on that because I didn't know how to approach it and how I can implement it into my projects.</p>
